### Breaking changes and important notes

🚀 Overall, this release gets us closer to a more robust, polished and user-friendly Helm chart. The time and quality invested in this release aim to bring it close to what you'd expect from a commercial product.

🚀 The `values.yaml` is now fully documented and it now supports JSON schema validation. A lot of time has gone into rewriting unit tests to catch potential issues and ensure the stability of this Helm chart. The new validator template and the JSON schema validation helps catch configuration errors early and provides much better feedback to users.

⚠️ Due to the refactor of the Helm chart structure, the `values.yaml` file has been reorganized and some configuration keys have been moved. Please refer to the updated [`values.yaml`](/charts/cert-manager-webhook-ovh/values.yaml) and the new [`README.md`](/charts/cert-manager-webhook-ovh/README.md) for details on the new structure and configuration options.

⚠️ ️Temporarily remove support for deployment `tolerations` due to a problem with the Helm Chart template rendering.
